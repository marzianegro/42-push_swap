# *push_swap*

## Description
This is a sorting algorithm project that challenges students to implement a program to sort a stack of integers using a set of predefined operations on two stacks.

## Features
- **Sorting Algorithm**: Implements an efficient sorting algorithm (Mechanical Turk by @byaliego) to order a stack of integers.
- **Stack Operations**: Uses operations such as swap, push, and rotate to manipulate two stacks.

## Getting Started
### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/marzianegro/42-push_swap.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd 42-push_swap
    ```

3. Compile the project:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

### Usage
1. Choose a stack of integers to be sorted.

2. Run the push_swap algorithm to sort the stack:

    ```bash
    ./push_swap [stack_of_integers]
    ```

### Example
```bash
# Run the push_swap algorithm
./push_swap 4 2 5 1 3
```
